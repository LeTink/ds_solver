# ds_solver
This is my take on a descrambler / solver for Drawsomething games

It is comprised of one python file, and dictionaries/wordlists for English, German and Spanish at this stage.

The large dictionary files come from Ubuntu's /usr/share/dict, the ds_words.\<lang\> ones are carfully manually assembled and get extended (amended) occasionally.

Latest update pushed to python 3.6
